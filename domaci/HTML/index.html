                  Novak topples Berankis to reach second week in Paris
                </h2>

                <p>
                  Nole faced no trouble during the match, dropping just six games en-route to the R4.

                  World no.1 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novak_Djokovic" target="_blank">Novak Djokovic</a> recorded a 6-1, 6-4, 6-1 victory on Saturday afternoon to book a place in the fourth round at Roland Garros.

                  The 2016 French Open titlist defeated <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ri%C4%8Dardas_Berankis" target="_blank">Ricardas Berankis</a> of Lithuania on Court Philippe-Chatrier in one hour and 32 minutes to claim his 23rd win on the season.

                  In the one-sided triumph, Novak dominated from the beginning. He broke his opponentâ€™s serve six times and did not face a single break point.

                  The Belgrade native won 88% of first-serve points (37/42) and was 11/15 on net approaches.

                  Match statistics: aces (5-1), double faults (3-3), winners (30-20), unforced errors (18-36), total points won (87-55).

                  Novak is into the last 16 for the 12th year in a row. He plays Lorenzo Musetti (ATP #76) on Monday for a spot in the quarter-finals in their first career encounter.

                  The 19-year-old Italian overcame compatriot Marco Cecchinato in his first ever five-set win (3-6, 6-4, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3).
